__PROJECT OBJECTIVE__ : 
The primary objective of this project is to create a Healthcare Database Management System that plays a crucial role in addressing the complexities of the healthcare industry, such as escalating costs, 
increasing demands for high-quality care, and an aging population. 

__FEATURES OF THIS PROJECT__ : 
- __Transactional Database Backbone__ : Our robust Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) database ensures real-time data integrity for day-to-day operations, including patient registrations and diagnosis recording.
- __Analytical Power of OLAP__ :Harness the analytical power of our Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) database. Dive deep into structured, transformed data for comprehensive healthcare insights.
- __ETL for Seamless Data Flow__ : Our Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process guarantees periodic updates to our OLAP database. This ensures a foundation for real-time analysis and reporting.
- __Monthly Executive Report__ : Gain instant access to crucial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) through our executive dashboards. Monitor Doctor-Patient interactions, Severity statistics, Disease prevalence, and more.
- __Medication Availability Dashboard__ :Explore our PowerBI dashboard offering real-time insights into medicine instock details. Connected to our OLTP database, it provides a snapshot of medication availability.
