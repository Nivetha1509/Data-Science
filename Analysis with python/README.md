__PROJECT OBJECTIVE:__ To determine the relationship between public health spending and mortality rates in the U.S., providing evidence-based insights to inform policy decisions aimed at enhancing population health
and optimizing resource allocation for life expectancy improvement. This concisely captures the project's core goal, the focus on public health spending, and the desired outcome for policymakers and public health officials.

__APPROACH:__ The approach encompasses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to unravel patterns and dependencies through univariate, bi-variate, and multivariate analyses. Merging datasets lays the foundation for a holistic
investigation, followed by meticulous data preparation to ensure integrity and enhance features. Investigative analysis will assess the strength and direction of relationships between life expectancy, Mortality rate, and
healthcare expenditures, while regression models will predict future Mortality rates based on historical spending and Mortality data. Visualizations, including line charts, scatter plots, and heat-maps, will illustrate 
trends and correlations. Interactive Plotly graphs enhance visualization. Additionally, Object-Oriented Programming will improve code organization and maintainability. 

__KEY INSIGHTS :__
In summary, this research investigates the interplay between Mortality trends and public health expenditures in the U.S., employing a multi-faceted approach that integrates diverse datasets, advanced analytics, and 
collaborative data management practices. The anticipated outcomes aim to inform healthcare policies and resource allocation strategies, providing valuable insights for proactive planning and decision-making in the 
healthcare sector.
